In the field of healthcare analytics, having clean, accurate, and high-quality data is crucial for making data-driven decisions, performing statistical analysis, and developing predictive models. However, real-world healthcare data is often plagued with multiple challenges such as:

Missing Values (like missing age, blood pressure, diagnosis, etc.)
Inconsistent Data Formats (like variations in gender or disease names)
Duplicate Records (same patient information repeated multiple times)
Outliers or Noisy Data (unrealistic or extreme values in data, e.g., age of 200 years, BP of 300/150)
Unprocessed Categorical Data (data in text form like Gender, Disease, Region, etc., which cannot be directly used in machine learning models)
If not handled properly, these issues can lead to:

Inaccurate Analysis – Poor insights or wrong conclusions from the data.
Biased Predictions – Machine learning models trained on poor-quality data will produce biased and unreliable predictions.
Model Failure – Algorithms may entirely fail to build a model if the data contains excessive missing or inconsistent data.
